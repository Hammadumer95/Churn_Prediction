# Churn_Prediction
Churn quantifies the number of customers who have unsubscribed or canceled their service contract. We are applying it on telco company dataset.  Customers turning their back to your service or product are no fun for any business. It is very expensive to win them back once lost, not even thinking that they will not do the best word to mouth marketing if unsatisfied.
